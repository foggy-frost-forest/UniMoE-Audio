| Prompt | Audio |
|:--:|:--:|
| This song contains several drum hits and percussive instruments playing a fast paced rhythm that motivates dancing along. An e-bass is bringing the low end supporting the drums. Cuatro guitars are strumming chords as a rhythmic addition. Trumpets are playing a loud and catchy melody. Some of the musical elements are slightly panned to the left and right side of the speakers. This song may be playing at a cheerful event. | <audio controls width="400" height="50"> <source src="https://github.com/foggy-frost-forest/UniMoE-Audio/raw/main/assets/audios/demo_1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> demo 1</audio> |
| This song contains a digital drum playing a simple pattern with a kick and a snare sound. Synthesizers are playing a repeating melody in the higher register. Another synth sound is playing a more aggressive lead sound with a countermelody. A string sample is being used to create a short hit. This song may be playing during a car ride. |<audio controls width="400" height="50"><source src="https://github.com/foggy-frost-forest/UniMoE-Audio/raw/main/assets/audios/demo_2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> demo 2</audio> |
| This is a four on the floor style of production. The song is a drum and bass type of song with a bright and fuzzy synth to add a melodic element. The first part of the song feels suspenseful. | <audio controls width="400" height="50"> <source src="https://github.com/foggy-frost-forest/UniMoE-Audio/raw/main/assets/audios/demo_3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> demo 3</audio>|
| This is a rock music piece. There is a medium-to-high pitched electric guitar solo at the forefront. In the melodic background, a keyboard and a bass guitar repeating the same pattern can be heard. The acoustic drums are playing a loud and slightly fast-paced rock drum beat. There is a rebellious atmosphere to this piece. It can be used in the soundtrack of a teenage drama or a crime shootout audio game. | <audio controls width="400" height="50"> <source src="https://github.com/foggy-frost-forest/UniMoE-Audio/raw/main/assets/audios/demo_4.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> demo 4</audio> |

## Structure

We introduce the Mix-of-ALL architecture‚Äîan end-to-end universal audio generation model capable of unified multimodal audio synthesis. The system incorporates several key innovations:

- Adaptive Computation Allocation: A routing mechanism dynamically selects the number of activated experts based on the uncertainty estimated per audio frame, enabling computation that adapts to varying information density and prediction difficulty.
- Multi-Granularity Expert Design: We deploy both dynamic and static experts. Dynamic experts are activated on-demand for task-specific processing, while static experts remain consistently active for general computation, achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency.
- Mixture-of-Attention Architecture: By introducing dynamic activation strategies into the attention modules, the model selectively activates attention heads, significantly expanding the parameter activation space and unlocking greater potential.

Together, these advances form a powerful and efficient framework for high-quality, flexible audio generation across multiple modalities. The model architecture and training pipeline are shown in the figures below:

## Installation
The following instructions are for Linux installation.

### 1. Clone this repository and navigate to the UniMoE Audio folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/foggy-frost-forest/UniMoE-Audio.git
cd UniMoE-Audio 
```

### 2. Set up environment
We recommend using conda to install the environment.
```bash
conda env create -f configs/enviroment.yml      # add -n for your name
conda activate unimoe-audio                     # default name
```
then install the torch packages
  ```bash
   # Use the official index
   pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 torchaudio==2.1.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   
   # Use Tsinghua mirror source
   pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 torchaudio==2.1.1 -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/ --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   
   # Use Alibaba Cloud mirror source
   pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 torchaudio==2.1.1 -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/ --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   ```
## UniMoE Audio Weights
All weights should be downloaded to ensure use.
After downloading all of them, organize the weights as follows in './models/UniMoE_Audio-preview' folder:
```
models
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UniMoE_Audio-preview
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model-00001-of-00003.safetensors
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model-00002-of-00003.safetensors
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model-00003-of-00003.safetensors
```

## How to infer and deploy your demo

### 1.Make sure that all the weights are downloaded and the running environment is set correctly.

### 2.Run inference scripts:

`inference.py`: Simplified inference function for quick single-task calls.
```bash
conda activate unimoe-audio
# Music Generating
python examples/inference.py --task text_to_music --input "Caption about music" --output ./music_output --model /path/to/your/model

# Voice Cloning / TTS
python examples/inference.py --task text_to_speech --input "Input text" --ref-audio ref.mp3 --ref-text "Reference text" --output ./speech_output --model /path/to/your/model
```

`inference_framework.py`: Complete batch processing framework with configuration files.
```bash
cd path/to/UniMoE-Audio/examples
conda activate unimoe-audio
python inference_framework.py --config config.json --tasks tasks.json --output-results results.json
```
Details can be found in the [examples/README.md](examples/README.md)

### To launch the online demo, run the following command:
```bash
python web_demo.py --model ./models/UniMoE_Audio-preview
```

<!-- ## How to evaluate on datasets
Evaluate the model on the datasets using the following command:
```bash
